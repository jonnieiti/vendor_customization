         cloud-to-device messaging service for apps to interact correctly with the modes
         (such as to be able to deliver an instant message to the device even when it is
         dozing).  This should be enabled if you have such services and expect apps to
         correctly use them when installed on your device.  Otherwise, keep this disabled

         These packages can contain services implementing location providers,
         such as the Geocode Provider, Network Location Provider, and Fused
         Location Provider.
         The signatures of packages named below and installed in the system
         image are "allowed" signatures.
         The location framework checks ALL installed packages if they provide
         an implementation of a specific location provider and compares the
         signature of the package with the list of allowed signatures.
         The location framework has support for installation of new or
         updated location providers at run-time. However the new package must
         have a signature that matches the signature of at least one package
         on this list which is installed in the system image.
         The chosen package for the specific location provider does not
         depend on the order of this list. -->
